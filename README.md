- 👋 Hi, I’m @abdullah790, I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual with a great interest in data science and analytics. As a Computer Science graduate, I am excited to begin my career in the dynamic world of data science. Over the course of my academic career, I have developed a strong background in data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques. I have hands-on experience with programming languages like Python and R and am proficient in using tools like Excel and Tableau to effectively visualize and interpret data.

Driven by a curiosity to solve complex problems, I have worked on a number of data-driven projects in which I applied data warfare, predictive modeling, and data visualization. to derive actionable insights. These experiences have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, and I look forward to applying them in real-life situations. My desire to contribute to the cutting edge of Data Science drives me to constantly learn and stay up to date with the latest industry trends and advancements. I am committed to making a positive impact through data-driven decision-making and creating innovative solutions to drive business success.
