- 👋 Hi, I’m @abdullah790, I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual with a great interest in Data Science, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. As a Computer Science graduate, I began my career as a frontend developer with an interest in Software Engineering. At the peak of the pandemic, I joined Arab International Laboratory where I worked with large data sources to conduct diagnostic analyses on patients' records and send mined data directly to Nigeria’s Center for Disease Control (NCDC) for national corroboration. The efficiency with which big data is used to understand trends, mitigate risks and effectively shape trajectories has heightened my quest for advanced knowledge in this field. I developed a strong background in data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques. I have hands-on experience with programming languages like Python, SQL, and R and am proficient in using tools like Excel and Tableau to effectively visualize and interpret data. I find the dynamic world of data science to be quite intriguing and provides numerous opportunities to leverage AI for good.
  
- Big data is generally about effective decision-making, and this applies to every industry. I aspire to leverage this application to prepare myself as a globally competitive institution for a career in which I will contribute to advancing Nigeria’s IT industry. I have already learned several programming languages such as C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP during my undergraduate degree. 
  
- Driven by a curiosity to solve complex problems, I have worked on several data-driven projects in which I applied data warfare, predictive modeling, and data visualization. to derive actionable insights. These experiences have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, and I look forward to applying them in real-life situations. My desire to contribute to the cutting edge of Data Science drives me to constantly learn and stay up to date with the latest industry trends and advancements. I am committed to making a positive impact through data-driven decision-making and creating innovative solutions to drive business success.
